# Goal Diggers Website
This website is a plattform for our fans and partners to get familiar with our team. It's also a plattform for veteran tournaments to be able to invite the team to their upcoming events.

## Features
The website has 3 pages: Home, Partners and Contact. in the future there may be more. 

All three pages has a navbar in which you can browse through the pages. I added a logo on the top left which links to "Home"-page. The menu has a hover effect which highlights hovered element with the same color as the gold-part of our apparels, with an active 2px line showing the user which page is active.

In the footer I've added a link to our Instagram and a Copyright label.

On the "Partners" page we have a link that sets up an e-mail to our genereal manager if the user is interested in becoming a partner to the team. The pop-up e-mail has a set subject phrase set to "I'm interested in becoming a partner to Goal Diggers".
